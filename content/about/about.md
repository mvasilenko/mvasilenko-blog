Hi, my name is Mikhail Vasilenko, I live in Kiev, Ukraine.

I'm father, engineer and human being, love my family, mountains, and some kinds of electronic music.

I believe in "automate all the things" approach, practice devops and cloud technologies.

Always wanted to know how the brain is working and puzzled by miracle of consciousness.
